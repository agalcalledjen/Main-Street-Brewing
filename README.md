# Main Street Brewing Rewards Program üç∫

Welcome to Main Street Brewery's rewards program app. Here you will be able to track points and spend them on available rewards.

Our team has built a native iOS app in a two and a half week period to help organize Main Street Brewery's rewards program. Users are able to gain points by purchasing goods. Features include a map with a list of locations that carry their beer, favoriting beers and upcoming events, and rewards that can be unlocked with points
